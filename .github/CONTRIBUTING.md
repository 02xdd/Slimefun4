# Slimefun Community Guidelines

Slimefun is a community project, everyone is welcome to open Issues, make Pull Requests or make Pull Requests for an opened Issue.
Without your help, this project is going to die.

## GitHub Issues

Rules for posting an Issue on GitHub:

1. This Issue Section is ONLY for Slimefun-related Issues, Issues about other Plugins or Slimefun Addons should not be posted here.
2. Check other Issues before posting to make sure you are not posting a duplicate.
3. Do not put any Tags inside your title like [IMPORTANT], [URGENT] or [SUGGESTION].
Try to be professional by making your title as short as possible, we will assign it the required labels if necessary.
4. Do not post your Issue more than once, this is considered spam and does not benefit our community in any way.
Do not repost your Issue if it was closed either.
5. Give us all available information right away, it may be a bit of time-wasting for us to keep asking for more Info.
6. Check whether there are newer versions available than the ones you are using, it might be that your Issue has been fixed already.

Your Issue will be CLOSED WITHOUT WARNING if we think you violated these Rules.

## Pull Requests

Guidelines for making a Pull Request on GitHub:

1. Try to be reasonable with your additions.
No, a Bacon flavoured unicorn that flies on a rainbow while dancing Gangnam Style is NOT a reasonable addition to this Project.
2. Try to make your values configurable in the config.yml / Items.yml or any additional file.
This may not be necessary at every instance but it does give the end-users a way to customize their experience.
3. If your Pull Request is made in response to an Issue opened on GitHub, 
comment on that Issue and reference your Pull Request to show that you are proposing a fix for it.
