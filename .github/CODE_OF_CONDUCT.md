# Slimefun4 - Code of Conduct
### What is a Code of Conduct?
> A code of conduct is a document that establishes expectations for behavior for your projectâ€™s participants. 
> Adopting, and enforcing, a code of conduct can help create a positive social atmosphere for your community.
<br>\- *Source: [https://opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/#why-do-i-need-a-code-of-conduct)*

This document should serve the purpose of outlining the behaviour we expect from any participant of the project.<br>

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all sections of the [Slimefun4 GitHub repository](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4), our [Slimefun GitHub organization](https://github.com/Slimefun) and all repositories owned by said organization.<br>
For our official discord server, please refer to our article on [Discord Rules](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Discord-Rules).

Everyone who engages with this project on any of these repositories is expected to follow the Code of Conduct.<br>
This includes maintainers, contributors, sponsors and anyone who engages in the "Issues" section on GitHub.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Our project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

If you want your issue to be handled discreetly, message `TheBusyBiscuit#2610` or `Walshy#9709` privately on discord and state your concerns.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
