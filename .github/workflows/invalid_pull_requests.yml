           Hey, it looks you edited a language file.
           
           We use [gitlocalize](https://gitlocalize.com/repo/3841) for handling localization, please don't submit any localization files
           via GitHub. That is sadly not possible.
           You can read more about how to translate Slimefun into your language [on our wiki page](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Translating-Slimefun).
